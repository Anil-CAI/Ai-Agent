<h1 align="center">🚀 Built My First AI Agent — And It’s Controlling My Browser Like Magic! 🤯🕹️</h1>

<h3 align="center">Ever imagined telling your computer “Go to YouTube and play my favorite song” — and it just does it?</h3>

<h2 align="left">🎶 What I Achieved Today</h2>

Well, that’s exactly what I made happen today! 🎶💻
Thanks to this brilliant YouTube tutorial 🎥 ([Watch it here](https://lnkd.in/d4WuTwXe)), I followed along (yes, I shamelessly copied the steps 😎) — and guess what?
I built an AI Agent that browses the web all by itself! 🌐🤖

---

<h2 align="left">🔥 What My Agent Did (Hands-Free!)</h2>

✔ Opened YouTube <br>
✔ Searched for **“Mawaa Yentaina”** <br>
✔ Clicked the top result <br>
✔ Started playing the song — like a pro DJ 🎧 <br>
✔ Even recorded its own browsing session into a **video** — proof that it works! 📸

<h2 align="left">⚡ Key Steps (For Fellow Techies Who Want To Try)</h2>

If you want to feel like a **tech wizard**, here’s the quick roadmap I followed:

📦 **Install the magic tools:**
```bash
pip install browser-use 
playwright install
```

📂 **Set up the project:**
```bash
git clone https://lnkd.in/d-yMe_e2
uv venv --python 3.11 
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

🚀 **Run the AI Agent UI:**
```bash
python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788
```

<h2 align="left">🧠 What Blew My Mind</h2>

🔹 This agent doesn’t just follow instructions blindly — it **thinks, plans, and adjusts** its actions based on what’s happening on the screen 🤖💡<br>
🔹 It **stores memories** — just like humans — so it remembers what it’s already done.<br>
🔹 The best part? It works **straight in the browser** — no clunky interfaces, just smart automation running directly in your favorite web apps!

<h2 align="left">🏁 Final Thoughts</h2>

This was my first-ever AI Agent project, and even though I copied the steps (**we all start somewhere!** 😅), it gave me a crystal-clear understanding of how AI agents work in real-time web environments.

🚀 **This is just the beginning** — I can’t wait to customize it for my own creative projects! 🎉
